## Summary

It's no secret that Netflix tracks what its users watch and how long they watch it, but Bandersnatch gave Netflix a unique opportunity to let the streaming giant learn what its users wanted in real time. Michael Veale, a technology policy researcher at University College London, wanted to know what data Netflix was collecting from Bandersnatch.

Users can formally request a company such as Netflix tell them the reason its collecting data, the categories they're sorting data into, third parties it's sharing the data with, and other information. Veale used this right of access to ask Netflix questions about Bandersnatch and revealed the answers in a Twitter thread. He found that Netflix is tracking the decisions its users make, and that it is keeping those decisions long after a user has finished the film.

Veale told me that requesting the data was as easy as sending Netflix an email, but the specifics of getting the information he want were complicated. Netflix didn't tell Veale how long it keeps the data and what the long term deletion plans are. Ultimately, Bandersnatch may seem safe, but what data Netflix scraped from its viewings, how that data is stored, and for how long are all questions users deserve to know.

### Nicolas Lopierre Aguirre's comments 

It's very interesting, and sort of relieving to see that one can ask Netflix what are they using our data for. It certainly takes away the whole privacy issue down a smaller scale. I wonder if you can post the link to the Twitter thread that you were talking about. Cheers.

### Charles Dickstein's Comments:
Perhaps Netflix is working on a way to A|B test films before a wide release. That would be a very innovative 
way to preview films. 

### Christine Welch's Comments:
This was very interesting to see the logged information of what seems like a more organic interaction when you watch the episode itself. It doesn't surprise me that Netflix is retaining user data long after occurrence, but it is still disheartenings. Likewise to hear that this information was shared without reluctance only because of the status of the inquiring party.
